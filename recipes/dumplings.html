    <h1>Beefy Chinese Dumplings</h1>
    <img src="../images/dumplings.jpg" alt="Dumplings">
    <p>This is a delicious meat and veggie dumpling recipe that my mom has been making ever since I can remember. It may
        take some time and practice when it comes to making these, but it's well worth it. Just boil them in water, and
        serve hot with soy sauce, or add them to a soup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
        <li>1 carrot, shredded</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package wonton wrappers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together beef, cabbage, carrot, and onion. Stir in the egg, sugar, salt, soy sauce, and
            vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Place a large teaspoonful of filling in the center of a dumpling skin. Moisten the edges of a wonton with a
            few drops of water. Then fold the dumpling in half, and pinch the edges together to seal. Create a ripple
            pattern along the pinched edge by pinching and gently pushing together small segments of it. Repeat with
            remaining dumplings.</li>
        <li>Boil the dumplings in water until they float to the top, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
