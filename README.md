# odin-recipes

This is a project that will combine all the
things i've learned so far from The Odin Project. This
project will be visited in the future to add additional features. For now, this will be the groundwork and basic HTML that will be implemented.

Throughout the initial entry of the project, I will be using the following:

- CLI/Git basics in order to commit/push files to GitHub
- Various elements and tags in HTML
    - basic elements and tags
    - lists
    - links/images
    - etc.

I learned a lot through this project. Some things went fairly well and were very simple while others were a bit frustrating. I would like to highlight the mistakes I made throughout working on this project as they all serve as great learning opportunities.

Firstly, I was looking at the live page that I posted from GitHub (https://immonroe.github.io/odin-recipes/index.html) when I was trying to update the titles of the recipe pages. Every time I made an edit in the code I would save it, then press F5 to refresh Chrome hoping to see the update populate in the browser and nothing happened. After a lot of confusion, it finally dawnwed on me that it's because I didn't go into my terminal and open the document from my odin-recipes directory. Instead, I was looking at the live site. In order for the live site to get updated, I'd have to make changes in my code, save them, and then go into my terminal and add/commit/push. Moving forward, I will be mindful that the live page only updates after pushing changes.

Next, I completely forgot to update the title for each recipe page so when you looked at the tabs in Chrome it read "Document" for each recipe. I updated this to match the recipes for each page and will be mindful of doing so in the future. I owe this change to someone who reviewed my project in The Odin Project discord.

Finally, I didn't adjust the size of the images at all so they vary a lot in size. (also a critique made by someone on The Odin Project discord). I know that I am still early in my learning and haven't learned about sizing images but it is no excuse to completely dismiss such an eyesore. Moving forward, I don't want to aim for the bare minimum to pass an assignment. I want to always try and improve my skills and make my projects looks clean and polished.

I also ran into one minor issue with trying to move/rename a donwloaded picture into a folder to use for the project. When I physically moved/renamed it, I could not find the picture for some odd reason when opening the images folder through terminal to the IDE. When I redownloaded the picture and renamed/moved file to correct folder through terminal it showed up just fine. Not sure if it was a corrupted file or not but it reminded me that working through terminal is so much easier than doing things the long way. I've gotten pretty comfortable with navigating the terminal for this particular project and hope to continue to further my skills and comfortablility in terminal.

Overall, this project was really fun and I will be visiting it in the future as I continue to improve my skills.
