# odin-recipes

This is a project that will combine all the
things i've learned so far from The Odin Project. This
project will be visited in the future to add additional features. For now, this will be the groundwork and basic HTML that will be implemented.

Throughout the initial entry of the project, I will be using the following:

- CLI/Git basics in order to commit/push files to GitHub
- Various elements and tags in HTML
    - basic elements and tags
    - lists
    - links/images
    - etc.
