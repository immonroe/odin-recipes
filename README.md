# odin-recipes is a project that will combine all the
things i've learned so far for The Odin Project. This
project will be visited in the future to add additional features.

Throughout the initial entry of the project, I will be using the following:

- CLI/Git basics in order to commit/push files to GitHub
- Various elements and tags in HTML
    - basic elements and tags
    - lists
    - links/images
    - etc.
